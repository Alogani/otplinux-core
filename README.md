## About

This repository contains the non-graphical elements of OTP for linux. It's meant to be used in any java program which wants to easily include OTP support without recoding it. Feel free to copy, modify and reuse this code as your liking.

OTP for linux is an open-source desktop client to manage and generate one-time passwords (OTP).

## How to use it

See my wikipage ! https://github.com/Alogani/otplinux-core/wiki/How-to-include-otplinux-core-in-your-java-code


## Miscelleanous

Because this project is not really mature, it is not recommanded to use it for production software.

Look at https://github.com/Alogani/otplinux if you wish to have a desktop OTP manager on your desktop
